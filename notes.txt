TODO:
- mysql data store
- Grab lists / Make super lists based on occurence
- The less popular a film, the higher weight of user recs from it are worth (or maybe just in final spreadsheet)
- Output to csv
- cache values need to handle the highest score value
- maybe get_recs_based_on_films only scans users that appear in x (30%?) number of films
- try to prune out ppl who give 5s for everything, if you know they have x pages of films and you are on x/2 and still hitting 5s you know half of their ratings
are 5s and they should be skipped
- store multiple dicts in redis to hydrate the whole object
- having the same rating on a lower popularity film should be weighted higher than having the same rating on a popular film
